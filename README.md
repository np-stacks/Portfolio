# Portfolio Website
**a very cool portfolio for me** <br />
- *Access the portfolio [`here`](stacks08.foo).*

<br />

**What is this?** <br />
This portfolio website uses a glassmorphism style. Simple colors, shapes, and blurs were put together to make this awesome page! The website shows my bio, projects, skills, and social links. You can use my website as a referenceâ€” but do not copy and paste the source code.

**How was this made?** <br />
This website was coded with `Tailwind CSS`, `React Vite` and `TypeScript`.
