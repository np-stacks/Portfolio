# Stacks's Profile Porfolio
**Welcome to the repo of my portfolio.** <br />

**What is this?** <br />
This portfolio website uses a glassmorphism style. Simple colors, shapes, and blurs were put together to make this awesome page! The website shows my bio, projects, skills, and social links. You can use my website as a referenceâ€” but do not copy the code.

**How was this made?** <br />
I used `React Vite`, `TypeScript`, `Replit`, and [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to make this website. The actual typescript and react files were compressed into `Javascript` and `HTML` file using `npm run build` to be hosted on GitHub. (That's the reason you don't see any React / TypeScript files here!)
